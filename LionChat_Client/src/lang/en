# This file contains the istructions so LionChat can speak! In this case, in english
# The very simple parser that reads this file can be configured in the source code
# Multi line comments aren't possible (yet)
# I made it to create a simple way to translate everything into other languages

# Blank lines are ignored

--- English # This sets the "en" language's name to "English". Only the first name given matters

test: This is a test sentence! # This creates a sentence named "test" with the inserted text. White space before and after is automatically trimmed
secondTest: This is another test sentence, this time with /*/ stuff! # This sentence will be divided in 2 parts by the separator sequence (/*/)
thirdTest: Wow! # The separator sequence is used by the program to know where to put stuff like the username!
# Only the first ':' character counts so the name can't have ':' characters in it
# The names for sentences are universal, the content changes based on the language!
